## 💡 About this Project

Doctor Appointment website quite useful website. In this project it consists of 3 parts:

- **Backend**
- **Frontend**
- **Admin**

You can easily **sign up** and **sign in** to the page. After that, you can see:

- Home
- All Doctors
- About
- Contact Page

If you go to the **All Doctors** page, you can choose **specialization** of doctor.  
If you choose one doctor, it immediately goes to the doctor's personal page, and then you can easily choose an **appointment date**.

If maybe you change your decision, you should go to the **profile page** and cancel your appointment.

I gave some rights to the **admin panel**, a few of them:

- Add a doctor’s personal information
- Graduation
- Specialization
- Picture, and so on.
