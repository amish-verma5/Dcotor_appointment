# FitConnect 🏋️‍♂️  
A personal fitness coaching platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS).

## 💡 About the Project

**FitConnect** is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with certified fitness coaches. It enables users to explore trainers by specialization (e.g., Yoga, Strength, Weight Loss), view trainer profiles, and book one-on-one coaching sessions.  

Users can register, log in, and manage their upcoming sessions via their dashboard. The admin panel allows trainers to update their profiles, availability, and qualifications. This project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development using the MERN stack.
